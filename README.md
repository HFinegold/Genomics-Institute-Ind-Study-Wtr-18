# Unsupervised Clustering Methods for RNA Sequencing Data

This project was completed through an independent study with the Genomics Institute at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The project aims to research and demonstrate state-of-the-art unsupervised clustering methods (PCA, k-means, t-SNE and TriMap) on RNA sequencing data. The data used was from the Expression Atlas, "RNA-seq from 53 human tissue samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project." The project also attempted to relate observed relationships to biological metadata.
